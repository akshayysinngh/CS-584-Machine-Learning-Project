# CS-584-Machine-Learning-Project

The project "Driver Drowsiness and Emotion Detection" is a machine learning project that aims to identify whether a driver is drowsy or not by 
analyzing their facial features, as well as detecting their emotions in real-time. The project uses various libraries, including Haar Cascade and Dlib.

The project is implemented using a deep neural network architecture that is trained on a dataset of images that include facial features of drivers 
who are both drowsy and alert, as well as images that show a range of emotions. The network can be trained to identify specific features associated 
with drowsiness, such as heavy eyelids or a downturned mouth, as well as the characteristic features of different emotions.

The project is be divided into two parts: drowsiness detection and emotion detection. 
For drowsiness detection, the system can use eye tracking technology to detect when a driver's eyes are closed or partially closed for an extended 
period of time, indicating drowsiness. 
For emotion detection, the system can analyze facial expressions to determine the driver's emotional state, using techniques such as facial landmark 
detection and tracking.
The project is be developed using Python and various libraries such as OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, and NumPy.
